=============
Tin Can Radar
=============

Utilities for designing, building, and using a $35 Tin Can Radar, from the original 2006 prototype
designed and built by Michael Hirsch and advised by Greg Charvat.

I include utilities for designing the Wilkenson power divider used to siphon off a sample
of the transmit waveform for the homodyne receiver.

I include design equations for using coffee cans for antennas,
as well as the more broadband Linear Tapered Slot Antenna.

If you need something more, start an issue or send a message.

Forward Model
=============
A forward model of linear/non-linear FMCW chirp is provided in Python using an optional Fortran library for speed.


Build
=======

* Mac: ``brew install gcc``
* Linux: ``apt install gfortran``
* Windows: install `gfortran <https://www.scivision.co/install-latest-gfortran-on-ubuntu/>`_



Install
-------
::

    pip install -e .


Matlab
======
Old scripts of some duplicity and perhaps not full correctness are in the matlab directory.

Optional
========

Fortran
-------
::

    cd bin
    cmake ..
    make
